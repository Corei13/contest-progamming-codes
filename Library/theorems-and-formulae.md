- **Graph Theory**
    - Erdős–Gallai theorem
        A sequence of non-negative integers d_1,...,d_n can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite simple graph on n vertices if and only if `d_1 + ... + d_n` is even and
        `d_1 + ... + d_k <= k(k-1) + min(d_{k+1}, k) + ... + min(d_n, k)`
